# Global Fireworks

Global Fireworks is just a mini-plugin inspired by [fireworks.js.org](https://fireworks.js.org/), which is created by [crashmax-dev](https://github.com/crashmax-dev/fireworks-js/).

You can find all the information on his GitHub. I'm just an amplifier for this wonderful thing. It will run on your Obsidian desktop for infinite time.

> NOTE: The "mouse click" and "mouse move" will not work yet.

The other stuff I have used are:

- [Heatmap Calendar](https://github.com/Baldev8910/Heatmap-Calendar--With-Seasons-)
- [Ranked Habit Tracker](https://github.com/Baldev8910/Ranked-Habit-Tracker)
- [Weekly Radar](https://github.com/Baldev8910/Weekly-Radar)
